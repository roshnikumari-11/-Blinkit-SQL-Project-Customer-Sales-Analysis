# 🛒 Blinkit SQL Project – Customer & Sales Analysis

This project is a simulation of a small e-commerce system (similar to Blinkit), built with sample data for **customers**, **products**, **orders**, and **order items**. It was created to practice writing intermediate SQL queries and generating valuable insights from structured data.
